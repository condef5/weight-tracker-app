      <p>
        An ideal weight is not an absolute target for either appearance or
         health. You can look great and be healthy at a wide range of weights. 
          It is also worth noting that being underweight is associated with poor 
          health outcomes and higher mortality for some conditions, as is being
        far above the healthy BMI range
