# Weight Tracker App - Ruby Module Evaluation

## Team Mighty Tracker

* Mayra Navarro (Project Coordinator)
* Frank Condezo (Tech Lead)
* Diego Torres
* Carlos Ayala
* Christopher Roa

## Instructions

Welcome to the evaluation for the Ruby module, where we’ll emulate the workflow of a software project. You will be assigned to a 4-5 people team and given an app to be build. Each group will have a different application, with different requirements. So no two projects will be the same.

- Each team will be assigned a Github repo inside the [Codeable organization](https://github.com/codeableorg)
  - [personal-library-app](https://github.com/codeableorg/personal-library-app)
  - [diary-app](https://github.com/codeableorg/diary-app)
  - [weight-tracker-app](https://github.com/codeableorg/weight-tracker-app)
  - [recipes-app](https://github.com/codeableorg/recipes-app)
- Inside the repo, you will find the `user stories` or requirements inside the **issues** tab at `/issues`
  - Each team member must be the owner of at least 1 user story. It’s up to your team how you plan to organize yourselves. Assign the issue to the team member who will be responsible.
  - You are required to implement at least 4 or 5 user stories, depending on the number of team members you have. So if your team has 5 people, your minimum is 5. If it has 4 members, you will only be required to implement 4.
  - While it is not mandatory to execute all user stories, the more the better.
  - Each user story has an _acceptance criteria_ (denoted by the checkbox) that your implementation **must** complete. Not delivering this is considered a **FAIL**
- Each team must define a _Tech Lead_ and a _Project Coordinator_, the list of the team members and the roles assigned should be added to the README of the repository (this document). Only the _Tech Lead_ is allowed to ask technical questions to the instructors and only the _Project Coordinator_ is allowed to ask questions regarding the requirements of the project.
- You are required to create just **ONE** pull request per user story.

## Evaluation

There are 2 main components to this exercise, with a total of 5 evaluation criteria:

- Group evaluation:
  - **Functionality / Code performance**
    - Does the code work as expected?
    - Does the app present any errors during its execution?
    - Has the _acceptance criteria_ been achieved for every requirement worked on?
    - Has any additional functionality been implemented? (beyond what has been asked for)
  - **Testing**
    - Is the functionality being tested using rspec?
    - Do the tests implemented make sense for what’s expected of the functionality?
    - Is there any critical functionality not being tested?
    - Do the tests run without any errors?

- Individual grade: Taking the user story for which you have been responsible for
  - **DRY-code (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**
    - Does the code repeats itself?
    - Is the code clean and easy to understand?
    - Is the code maintainable by another person?
  - **Code review:** You are required to provide at least 2 code reviews to your team members. Please organize with your team for who is doing review of whom, so no one is left hanging.
    - Has the student code reviewed at least 2 pull request from their team?
    - Is the feedback valuable and insightful?
    - Did the exchange spar positive discussion and make the codebase better?
  - **Pull requests:** Your PR is not just about pushing code, but also a communication tool with your team.
    - Is the PR in a good and understandable English?
    - How good does the PR describe what has been worked on? Is it possible to understand their thought process on why the implementation has been done this way?
    - Has at least 2 people from the team `approved` the PR before it being merged?
